# Mildew Detection in Cherry Leaves
Live version [here](https://mildew-detector-in-leaves-1c41d59dd8ae.herokuapp.com/)

## Business Requirements

The cherry plantation crop from Farmy & Foods is facing a challenge where their cherry plantations have been presenting powdery mildew. Currently, the process is manual verification if a given cherry tree contains powdery mildew. An employee spends around 30 minutes on each tree, taking a few samples of tree leaves and verifying visually if the leaf is healthy or has powdery mildew. If there is powdery mildew, the employee applies a specific compound to kill the fungus. The time spent applying this compound is 1 minute. The company has thousands of cherry trees located on multiple farms across the country. As a result, this manual process is not scalable due to the time spent in the manual inspection process.

To save time in this process, the IT team suggested an ML system that detects instantly, using a leaf tree image, if it is healthy or has powdery mildew. A similar manual process is in place for other crops for detecting pests, and if this initiative is successful, there is a realistic chance to replicate this project for all other crops. The dataset is a collection of cherry leaf images provided by Farmy & Foods, taken from their crops.

### Key Business Requirements:
- 1  The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a healthy cherry leaf from one with powdery mildew.
- 2  The client is interested in predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.

## Hypothesis and how to validate?

### Hypothesis 1:
There are distinguishable visual patterns between healthy leaves and leaves infected with powdery mildew.
- **Validation:** We will use image analysis techniques such as averaging, variability, and difference images to identify potential visual patterns. Comparing these visual patterns will allow us to visually differentiate the two classes of leaves.

### Hypothesis 2:
A machine learning model that can predict whether a leaf is healthy or infected with high accuracy.
- **Validation:** We will build a classification model using a dataset of labeled cherry leaf images, healthy vs powdery mildew, and measure its accuracy and loss on predictions.

### Business Requirement 1: 
The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a cherry leaf that is healthy from one that contains powdery mildew.

**Rationale:** To create the visual study we are going to generate several visualizations:
- **Average Image:** Creating average images of healthy and infected leaves to identify general patterns.
- **Variability Images:** Displaying the differences between each category to highlight consistent features.
- **Difference Image:** Creating a difference image between healthy and powdery mildew leaves to highlight the areas of the image that differ the most.

These visualizations will help answer the business question of whether healthy and infected leaves are visually distinct, and if so, how.

### Business Requirement 2: 
The client is interested in predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.

**Rationale:** Develop a Machine Learning model that can automatically classify images of healthy or powedered mildew leaves. This involves:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Resizing, and augmenting the leaf images to ensure they are suitable for machine learning.
- **Model Development:** Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the images.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model performance. The agreed performance with the client is an accuracy of at least 97%.

## ML Business Case

**Current Process:** The company currently spends around 30 minutes per tree inspecting leaves manually. This process is not scalable for large farms, leading to increased labor costs and inefficiencies.

**Proposed Solution:** The ML model will provide real-time detection of powdery mildew from images of cherry leaves, reducing the time required for inspection and allowing the company to scale the inspection process.

**Key Benefits:** 
- **Cost Reduction:** Automated leaf inspection will save significant time and labor costs.
- **Improved Efficiency:** The process will become scalable across large cherry plantations.
- **Product Quality:** The system will ensure better quality control by identifying and treating powdery mildew in its early stages.

## Fixed Bugs

- **Prediction of images with different sizes (other than 256x256px):** Initially, predictions failed because the code expected a 3-channel RGB image but received 4-channel images. The fix involved modifying the code to ensure that uploaded images are correctly converted to the desired RGB format and the correct dimensions before passing them to the model for prediction.
